Types of Constructors:

1. Default or Parameter Less Constructor
	- If a constructor method doesn't take any parameters.
	- These constructors can be defined by the programmer explicitly or else will be defined implicitly by the
	compiler provided there is no explicit constructor under the class.

	Eg.

		class Test
		{
			public Test()  //implicit constructor
			{
			}
		}

2. Parametrized Constructor
	- If a constructor method is defined without any parameters we call that cas parametrized constructors.
	- Thse constructors can eb defined by the programmer only.

3. Copy Constructor
	- If we want to create multiple instances with the same value, we can use these copy constructors.
	- In a copy constructor, the  constructor takes the same class as a parameter to it.
4. Static Constructor
