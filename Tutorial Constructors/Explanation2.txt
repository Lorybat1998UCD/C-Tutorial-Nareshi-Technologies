Types of Constructors:

1. Default or Parameter Less Constructor
	- If a constructor method doesn't take any parameters.
	- These constructors can be defined by the programmer explicitly or else will be defined implicitly by the
	compiler provided there is no explicit constructor under the class.

	Eg.

		class Test
		{
			public Test()  //implicit constructor
			{
			}
		}

2. Parametrized Constructor
	- If a constructor method is defined without any parameters we call that cas parametrized constructors.
	- Thse constructors can eb defined by the programmer only.

3. Copy Constructor
	- If we want to create multiple instances with the same value, we can use these copy constructors.
	- In a copy constructor, the  constructor takes the same class as a parameter to it.

4. Static Constructor
	- If a constructor is explicitly declared by using the static modifier we call it a static constructor. 
	- All the constructors have defined so far are non-static or instance constructors.

	Eg.

		class Test
		{
			static Test() //static constructor defined explicitly
			{
			}
			public Test() //Implicit default constructor
			{
			}
		}

	- If a class contains any static variables, then only implicit static constructors will be present or else
	we need to define them explicitly, whereas non-static constructors will be implicitly deifned in every class
	(except static class) provided we did not define them explicitly.
