Constructor:

- It's a special method present under a class responsible for initialising the variables of that class.

- The name of a constructor is exactly the same name of the class in which it was present, and moreover it's a non-returning method

- Each and every class requires this constructor if we want to create the instance of the class

Eg. 

class Test{
	int i;
}

Test obj = new Test(); //Valid

It's the responsibility of the programmer to define the constructor under their class. If this is not done, an implicit constructor is 
defined in the class by the compiler:

class Test{
	int i;
	string s;
	bool b;
	
	public Test()
	{	
		i = 0;
		s=null;
		b=false;	
		}
	}

- Implicitly defined constructors are parameter-less and these constructors also known as default constructors.

- Implicitly defined constructors are public.

- We can also define a constructor under the calss and if we define it we can call it as an explicit constructor. This can be parameterless
or parametrized.

If we want to define it explicitly:

	[<modifiers>] <Name> ( [<parameter list>] )
	{
		-statements
	}

Defining a constructor means implementing a constructor in the project. 
Can be implicit or explicit (compiler or programmer defined).

Calling should be done Explicitly.
